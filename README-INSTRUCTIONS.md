# How to Add Resources

To add new simulations, PDFs, PowerPoints, or other files for students:

1. Place the file in the correct subject/unit folder:
   - For Chemistry: `sims/chemistry/unit-X/`
   - For Earth Sciences: `sims/earth-sciences/unit-X/`
   - For Physics: `sims/physics/unit-X/`
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `balancing-equations.pdf`, `plate-tectonics.pptx`).
3. The site will automatically list all files in each unit folder for students to access.
4. To update or remove a resource, simply update or delete the file in the folder.

No need to edit HTML! The site will show new files automatically.

If you need to add a new unit, create a new folder (e.g., `unit-7`) and add your files there.

For help, contact your site maintainer.
