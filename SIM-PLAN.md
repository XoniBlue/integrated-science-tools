# Simulation Coverage Plan

This roadmap uses Unit 1 page structure and interaction style as the reference standard:
- shared layout pattern (`sim-wrap`, `container`, top action links, two-panel workspace)
- interactive controls with immediate computed feedback
- topic-specific quantitative logic per simulation

## Unit Coverage Targets (3-5 each)

Unit 1: Chemical Bonds and Fundamental Forces
- Implemented: `lewis-dot.html`, `electron-configuration.html`, `equation-balancer.html`, `molecular-geometry.html`, `ph-titration.html`
- Status: 5 of 5 target complete

Unit 2: Molecules and Engineering Solutions
- Implemented: `molecular-polarity.html`, `solution-mixer.html`, `material-selector.html`
- Next additions: reaction-rate tuner, separation-technique chooser
- Status: 3 of 5 target (minimum complete)

Unit 3: Energy and Orbital Motion
- Implemented: `energy-conversion.html`, `orbital-motion.html`, `resonance-lab.html`
- Next additions: gravitational potential map, wave-energy transfer lab
- Status: 3 of 5 target (minimum complete)

Unit 4: Fields, Forces, and the Universe's Origin
- Implemented: `field-superposition.html`, `gravity-well.html`, `cosmic-expansion.html`
- Next additions: magnetic flux lab, redshift classifier
- Status: 3 of 5 target (minimum complete)

Unit 5: Apply the Laws of Motion
- Implemented: `force-balance.html`, `motion-graph-lab.html`, `ramp-dynamics.html`
- Next additions: projectile planner, circular-motion force lab
- Status: 3 of 5 target (minimum complete)

Unit 6: Momentum, Mechanics, and Engineering Solutions
- Implemented: `collision-lab.html`, `impulse-analyzer.html`, `crash-absorber.html`
- Next additions: center-of-mass tracker, rotational inertia design lab
- Status: 3 of 5 target (minimum complete)

## Build Sequence for Expansion to 5/Unit

1. Add the two planned sims for Unit 2 and update `unit-2/index.html`.
2. Add the two planned sims for Unit 3 and update `unit-3/index.html`.
3. Add the two planned sims for Unit 4 and update `unit-4/index.html`.
4. Add the two planned sims for Unit 5 and update `unit-5/index.html`.
5. Add the two planned sims for Unit 6 and update `unit-6/index.html`.
6. Run a final consistency pass for naming, card copy, and mobile layout behavior.
